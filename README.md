# myuow-data

This project is live at: https://myuow.venuatu.me/api/ with a nice frontend at https://myuow.venuatu.me/ ([repo](https://github.com/venuatu/myuow))

This is a scraper for UOW subject and timetabling information that may reach into SOLS (the internal student self service portal)

## Why?

I needed a project to get better at scala and porting the previous hackathon built version seemed like a good idea.

## What is this using?

-   Scala 2.10
    -   [SIP-22 Async](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/async.html) https://github.com/scala/async
-   Play 2.2
-   TDD
    -   Specs2 (unit testing)
    -   Mockito (mocking)
